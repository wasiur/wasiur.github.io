1. [Kirsty Bolton](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mathematics/people/kirsty.bolton), [Yordan Raykov](https://www.yordanraykov.net/), and I are organizing a one-day workshop on "Recent challenges in mathematical epidemiology". More details available [here](https://wasiur.xyz/EpiWorkshopSep2022/EpiWorkshopSep2022.html)

The OSU/IDI COVID-19 response modeling team received much appreciation. I am fortunate to have contributed to this effort. Here are some highlights:
