## Research Interests
Stochastic processes on random graphs, stochastic processes limits, queueing theory, large deviations, approximations of Markov Processes, machine learning, stochastic epidemiology, stochastic modelling and simulation of chemical reaction networks.

I am looking for PhD students. I have several projects in the following broad areas of mathematics:

* Applied Probability
* Stochastic Processes
* Epidemic Modelling
* Mathematical Biology
* Stochastic Reaction Networks

If you are interested in any of these areas, please get in touch with me!
