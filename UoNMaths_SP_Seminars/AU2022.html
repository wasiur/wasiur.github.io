              <em>Causal inference from high-dimensional observational studies poses intriguing challenges. In this context,
                the augmented inverse probability weighting estimator is widely used for average treatment effect
                estimation. This estimator exhibits fascinating properties, such as double robustness. However, existing
                statistical guarantees rely on some form of sparsity in the underlying model, and may fail to apply in
                practical settings when these assumptions are violated. In this talk, we present a new central limit theorem
                for this estimator, that applies in high dimensions, without sparsity-type assumptions on underlying
                signals. Specifically, we work in the proportional asymptotics regime, where the number of features and
                samples are both large and comparable. Our work uncovers novel high-dimensional phenomena that are
                strikingly different from their classical counterparts. To conclude, we discuss opportunities that arise in
                our framework, when modern machine-learning-based estimators are used for learning the high-dimensional
                nuisance parameters. On the technical front, our work utilizes a novel interplay between three distinct
                tools---the theory of deterministic equivalents, approximate message passing theory, and the leave-one-out
                approach (alternately known as the cavity method in statistical physics).

              <em>A major challenge for causal inference from time-series data is the trade-off between computational
                feasibility and accuracy. Motivated by process motifs for lagged covariance in an autoregressive model with
                slow mean-reversion, we propose to infer networks of causal relations via pairwise edge measures (PEMs) that
                one can easily compute from lagged correlation matrices, and we formulate two PEMs that respectively correct
                for confounding factors and for reverse causation. To demonstrate the performance of our PEMs, we consider
                network inference from simulations of linear stochastic processes, and we show that our proposed PEMs can
                infer networks accurately and efficiently. Specifically, for autocorrelated time-series data, our approach
                achieves accuracies higher than or similar to Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent
                crossmapping---but with much shorter computation time than possible with any of these methods. Our fast and
                accurate PEMs are easy-to-implement methods for network inference with a clear theoretical underpinning.
                They provide promising alternatives to current paradigms for the inference of linear models from time-series
                data, including Granger causality, vector-autoregression, and sparse inverse covariance estimation.</em>

              <summary><b>Abstract:</b> </summary>
              <em>Model-based clustering represents one of the fundamental procedures in a statistician's toolbox. Within
                the model-based clustering framework, we consider the case where the kernel distribution of nonparametric
                mixture models is available only up to an intractable normalizing constant, in which most of the commonly
                used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods fail to provide posterior inference. To overcome this problem, we
                propose an approximate Bayesian computational strategy, whereby we approximate the posterior to avoid the
                intractability of the kernel. By exploiting the structure of the nonparametric prior, our proposal combines
                the use of predictive distributions as a proposal with transport maps to obtain an efficient and flexible
                sampling strategy. Further, we illustrate how the specification of our proposal can be relaxed by
                introducing an adaptive scheme on the degree of approximation of the posterior distribution. Empirical
                evidence from simulation studies shows that our proposal outperforms its main competitors in terms of
                computational times while preserving comparable accuracy of the estimates.</em>

              <em>The infinite-parent spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot process is a model for spatially expanding populations in
                a two dimensional continuum, in which empty areas are filled with ghost individuals. This model can be seen
                as a continuous-space version of the Eden growth model, and it comes with a dual process that allows us to
                trace back the origins of a sample of individuals taken from the current population. In this talk, we shall
                focus on the growth properties of the area covered by real individuals. With the help of a simple toy model,
                we shall also investigate how the fluctuations at the front edge lead to a much larger speed of growth of
                the occupied region than that predicted by simple first-moment estimates.

              <em>In this talk, I'll discuss adaptive statistical inference based on variational Bayes. Although a number of
                studies have been conducted to analyze theoretical properties such as posterior contraction properties of
                variational posteriors, there is still a lack of general and computationally tractable variational Bayes
                methods that can achieve adaptive inference. To fill this gap, we propose a novel adaptive variational Bayes
                framework, which can operate on a collection of models. The proposed framework first computes a variational
                posterior over each individual model separately and then combines them with certain weights to produce a
                variational posterior over the entire model. It turns out that this combined variational posterior is the
                closest member to the posterior over the entire model in a predefined family of approximating distributions.
                We show that the proposed variational posterior achieves optimal contraction rates adaptively under very
                general conditions and attains model selection consistency when the true model structure exists. We apply
                the general results obtained for the adaptive variational Bayes to a large class of statistical models
                including deep learning models and derive some new and adaptive inference results.</em>

              <em>
                <p> Regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) have been developed for the estimation of treatment effects
                  using observational data, where a treatment is administered using an externally defined decision rule
                  linked to a continuous assignment variable. Typically, RDDs have been applied to situations where the
                  outcome of interest is continuous and non-temporal. Conversely, RDDs for time-to-event outcomes have
                  received less attention, despite such outcomes being common in many applications.</p>
                <p>We consider RDDs for a time-to-event outcome subject to right censoring. An accelerated failure time
                  approach is used to establish a treatment effect estimate for a fuzzy RDD (where treatment is not always
                  strictly applied according to the decision rule). This estimation approach is robust to different levels
                  of fuzziness and unobserved confounding, assessed using simulation studies, and compares favourably to
                  established structural accelerated failure time models. A brief example is presented in which models are
                  fitted to estimate the effect of metformin on mortality and cardiovascular disease rate using real
                  observational data from UK Primary Care.</p>

              <em> Motivated by recent biological experiments, we emphasize the effects of small and random populations on
                long time population dynamics. We will quantify such effects on macroscopic approximations. The individual
                behaviors are described by the mean of a stochastic measure-valued process. We study different long time
                asymptotic behaviors depending on the assumptions on mutation size and frequency and on horizontal
                transmission rate. In some cases, simulations indicate that these models should exhibit surprising
                asymptotic behaviors such as cyclic behaviors. We explore these behaviors on a simple model where population
                and time sizes are on a log-scale. Explicit criteria are given to characterize the possible asymptotic
                behaviors. The impact of the time and size scales on macroscopic approximations is also investigated,
                leading to Hamilton-Jacobi equations.</em>

              <em> Multivariate time series analysis aims to uncover the joint dynamic behaviour of different time
              series, yt. Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models aim to capture the self and cross autocorrelation
              structure of the time series by extending the univariate autoregressive model to the multivariate
              setting. VARs however, are linear models with Gaussian innovations, and this can limit the
              models’ ability of accurately capturing the joint dynamics of the different time series. Kalli and
              Griffin (2018) introduced the Bayesian nonparametric vector autoregressive model (BayesNP-
              VAR) where the stationary and transition densities of the dynamic system are modelled using
              Bayesian nonparametric mixture models. This allows for nonlinearity in the conditional mean,
              heteroscedasticity in the conditional variance, and non-Gaussian innovations leading to better out-
              of-sample forecasts. The component weights of the mixture transition density depend on previous
              lags of vector yt, and the lagged values can inform: 1) which component the current yt will fall in,
              and 2) how the magnitude and direction of a change between yL and yL signals a switch from t t−1
              one component to another. In this presentation, I will talk about two developments. Firstly, by introducing a method of
              interpreting the BayesNP-VAR by decomposing the component weights of the mixture transition density. Secondly, by
              introducing non-stationarity to the BayesNP-VAR model using time-dependent mixture weights. The resulting model is
              referred to as Bayesian time varying weight VAR (BayesNP-TW-VAR). I will describe the construction of the BayesNP-TW-
              VAR, consider some of its properties, and discuss its out-of-sample forecasting performance.</em>

              <em> First Nations populations have experienced a demonstrably higher burden of disease due to COVID-19 in multiple
              countries. Poorer clinical outcomes in such settings are a likely result of increased transmission risk due to younger
              populations with different community structures, challenges with access to culturally appropriate medical services,
              higher prevalence of clinical risk determinants and historical inequities.
              
              In Australia at the start of 2021, leadership by a nationally representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
              advisory group on COVID-19 (IAG, co-chaired by the Department of Health and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled
              Health Organisation) had been effective at limiting COVID-19 health impacts in both urban and rural/remote living
              communities. However, as national vaccination targets began to be achieved, vaccine uptake in remote Australia had
              fallen behind the national average, leaving many Indigenous communities susceptible to incursion and localised
              outbreaks.
              
              In this presentation I will describe modelling work undertaken during 2021 in partnership with the IAG to understand the
              levels of pre-emptive and reactive public health measures, including vaccination and nonpharmaceutical interventions,
              that would be necessary to ensure protection against the COVID-19 Delta variant for remote-living Indigenous
              Australians. This work demonstrated the ability of reactive vaccination as part of outbreak response to improve overall
              health outcomes, and informed the refinement of the IAG’s COVID-19 outbreak preparedness and response guidelines. More
              broadly, the work highlights the importance of considering heterogeneity in risk of transmission and severe disease in
              outbreak management at national and subnational levels.</em>
